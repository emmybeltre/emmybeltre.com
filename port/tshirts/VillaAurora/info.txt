desc:Villa Aurora, located in Florence, Italy, wanted to revamp their whole recruitment packet. My job was simply to come up with an effective shirt design that could be handed out at recruitment events and kept as souvenirs by potential students. The design is simple and utilizes the fleur de lis used in much of the work in the city of Florence.
