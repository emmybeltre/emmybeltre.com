title:Chopin 
desc:This poster was made while I was still in college. While the event is not actually real it still remains one of my favorite pieces. I was able to take the illustration of Frederick Chopin that I had made and combine it with type to make a piece that I felt would best fit the event. The final project was printed on 80# French Speckletone Natural paper
