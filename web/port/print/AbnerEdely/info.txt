desc:I was approached by Abner and Edely to make their wedding stationary. They wanted a Spring look to their stationary that looked more like the beginnings of Spring and less green. I utilized vectors images to embellish the type treatment on the invites as well as the RSVP's. These were all printed on 80# French Speckletone Paper.
