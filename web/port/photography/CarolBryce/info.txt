desc:The Andersons let me use them as models for a CD booklet that I wanted to make. This shoot was fun and a bit of a challenge. Before the shoot started there was enough natural light to forego any reflectors. However halfway through the shoot it became cloudy. Using random materials that were in my car I was able to make a reflector out of aluminum foil and a science project display board.
