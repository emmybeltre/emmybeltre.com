	<img src="images/me.png" style="float:right;" alt="">My name is Emmy Jesus Beltre. I am a graphic Designer. There’s nothing more that I love doing. Well besides eating…and traveling. And playing sports. Ok so there are a lot of things that I like but few things that I am passionate about. So let’s get one thing clear. I am passionate about design. I think that graphic design a great form of communication. It’s a way to make intangible ideas and concepts tangible. It’s that simple. I love what I do and I love working with people and building relationships. So if you like what you see on this site by all means feel free to contact me. If you don’t a have computer send a telegram. If you don’t own technology and heard about me by word of mouth send a smoke signal. Thanks for stopping by. I hope to hear from you soon.
